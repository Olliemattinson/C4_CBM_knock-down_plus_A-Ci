This repository contains the one-cell model (in the data directory), and the jupyter notebook (in the notebooks directory) from which the two-cell model can be generated and run to generate the FBA output and simulated A-Ci curves. 
To run the Jupyter notebook on a local machine, check the environment.yml file for information on required packages and versions.


The one-cell and two-cell models were developed in Blätke and Bräutigam (2019) ‘Evolution of C4 photosynthesis predicted by constraint-based modelling’. eLife. 8:e49305. The files used for running the model developed in that study are also utilised here. The jupyter notebook used to generate and run the two-cell model in this directory is modified from a jupyter notebook used in that study.
